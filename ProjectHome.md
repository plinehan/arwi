Arwi is a simple, location-based alarm clock for the Android platform.

Do you want to sleep on the bus or train, but are afraid you'll miss your stop?  Arwi can wake you up when you get there.

Do you keep forgetting to pick up your dry cleaning?  Arwi can remind you next time you drive past.

Arwi is still in early development, so its not ready for casual users.  It is open source, though, and we welcome any help.  The source may be licensed under the GPL v2 (or later).
